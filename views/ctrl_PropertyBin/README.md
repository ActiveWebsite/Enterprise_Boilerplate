#Property Bin

To use the bootstrap be sure to use the following dropin options:

	{render_dropin dropin="PropertyBin" bootstrap=true propsInRow=3 addBootstrapDropdown=true}

LESS for this view is located at the system level. To provide overrides simply add them to your `client_side/less/overrides.less` file. There is a section designated for this.

This set it to use bootstrap, add the dropdown js file, and that we have 3 properties in each row within the bin.
